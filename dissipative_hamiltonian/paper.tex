\begin{abstract}
Reduced basis methods are popular for approximately solving large and complex systems of differential equations. However, conventional reduced basis methods do not generally preserve conservation laws and symmetries of the full order model. Here, we present an approach for reduced model construction, that preserves the symplectic symmetry of dissipative Hamiltonian systems. The method constructs a closed reduced Hamiltonian system by coupling the full model with a canonical heat bath. This allows the reduced system to be integrated with a symplectic integrator, resulting in a correct dissipation of energy, preservation of total energy and, ultimately, in the stability of the solution. Accuracy and stability of the method are illustrated through the numerical simulation of the dissipative wave equation and a port-Hamiltonian model of an electric circuit.

\section{Skew Symmetric and Centered Schemes for Fluid Flows} \label{sec:skew}

\subsection{Conservation Laws} \label{sec:skew.1}
Transport of conserved quantities, in the context of fluid flows, can be formulated as
\begin{equation} \label{eq:3.1}
	\frac{\partial }{\partial t} \rho \varphi + \nabla \cdot ( \rho u \varphi  ) = \nabla \cdot F_{\varphi}\quad \text{defined in} \quad \Omega \subset \mathbb R^{d}.
\end{equation}
Here, $d = 1,2$ or $3$, $\rho:\Omega\to \mathbb R$ is the density, $u\in \Omega \to \mathbb R^{d}$ is the velocity vector field, $\varphi$ is a measured scalar quantity of the flow, and $F_{\varphi}$ is the flux function associated to $\varphi$. Integration of \eqref{eq:3.1} over $ \Omega$ yields
\begin{equation} \label{eq:3.2}
	\frac{d}{dt} \int_{\Omega} \rho \varphi \ dx = \int_{\partial \Omega} (F_{\varphi} - \rho u \varphi) \cdot \hat n\ ds,
\end{equation}
where $\partial \Omega$ is the boundary of $\Omega$, and $\hat n$ is the unit outward normal vector to $\partial \Omega$. When the right hand side of \eqref{eq:3.2} vanishes, e.g. in case where $\Omega$ is periodic and $\varphi$ is flux-free, the quantity $(\rho \varphi)$ is conserved. Therefore, the form \eqref{eq:3.1} is referred to the \emph{conservative form} and the convective term in \eqref{eq:3.1} is referred to as the \emph{divergence form}. However, using the \emph{continuity equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:3.3}
	\frac{\partial }{\partial t} \rho + \nabla \cdot (\rho u) = 0,
\end{equation}
we can rewrite \eqref{eq:3.1} as
\begin{equation} \label{eq:3.4}
	\rho \frac{\partial }{\partial t} \varphi + (\rho u)\cdot \nabla \varphi = \nabla \cdot F_{\varphi}.
\end{equation}
The convective term in this formulation is referred to as the \emph{advective form}. The \emph{skew-symmetric} form for the convective term is obtained by the arithmetic average of the divergent and the advective form:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:3.5}
	\frac{1}{2} \left( \rho \frac{\partial }{\partial t} \varphi + \frac{\partial }{\partial t} (\rho \varphi) \right) + \frac 1 2 \left( (\rho u)\cdot \nabla \varphi + \nabla \cdot (\rho u \varphi) \right) = \nabla \cdot F_{\varphi}.
\end{equation}
Multiplying \eqref{eq:3.5} with $\varphi$ yields
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial }{\partial t} \rho \varphi^2 + \nabla \cdot ( \rho u \varphi^2  ) = \varphi \nabla \cdot F_{\varphi}.
\end{equation}
Therefore, $\varphi^2$ is a conserved quantity for a flux-free $\varphi$. Since the divergence, the advective and the skew-symmetric forms are identical at the continuous level, then $\varphi^2$ is a conserved quantity for all forms. However, equivalence of these forms is not preserved through a general discretization scheme and, therefore, we do not expect $\varphi^2$ to be a conserved quantity in discrete level. Assuming proper boundary conditions, the operator 
\begin{equation}
	S_{\rho u}(\cdot) = \frac 1 2 ( [ \nabla \cdot \rho u ] + (\rho u)\cdot \nabla )(\cdot),
\end{equation}
is a skew-adjoint operator with respect to the $L^2$ inner-product. Here, $[\cdot]$ indicates that the inside of brackets act as a differential operator. This skew-adjoint property is used in later sections to show the conservation of some quadratic quantities in \eqref{eq:3.1}. Similarly, we can define the skew-adjoint operator in time variable as
\begin{equation}
	S_{\rho,\partial_t} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \rho \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + [ \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \rho] \right).
\end{equation}
Here, the subscript $\partial t$ is to emphasize that $S_{\rho,\partial_t}$ is a differential operator with respect to $t$. Note that numerical time integration of \eqref{eq:3.5} can be challenging since the time differentiation of different variable is present. However, following derivations in \cite{morinishi2010skew}, one can rewrite \eqref{eq:3.5} as
\begin{equation} \label{eq:3.6}
	\sqrt{\rho } \frac{\partial }{\partial t} (\sqrt \rho \varphi ) + S_{\rho u}(\varphi) = \nabla \cdot F_{\varphi}.
\end{equation}
Time integration of this form is presented in the works of \cite{?}. Note that one can also generate a quasi-skew-symmetric form \cite{blaisdell1991numerical,morinishi2003dns} of \eqref{eq:3.1} as
\begin{equation} \label{eq:3.7}
	\frac{\partial }{\partial t} (\rho \varphi) + S_{\rho u}(\varphi) = \nabla \cdot F_{\varphi}.
\end{equation}
Even though this is not a fully skew-symmetric form (skew-symmetric only in space), the numerical stabilities of this form is significantly better than the divergence and advective form \cite{morinishi2010skew,blaisdell1991numerical,morinishi2003dns}. Note that the quasi-skew-symmetric form is identical to the skew-symmetric form in the incompressible limit.

\subsection{Incompressible Fluid} \label{sec:skew.2}
Consider the governing equations of an incompressible fluid with skew-symmetric convective term:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:3.8}
	\left\{
	\begin{aligned}
	&\nabla \cdot u = 0, \\
	&\frac{\partial}{\partial t} u + S_{u}(u) + \nabla p = \nabla \cdot \tau,
	\end{aligned}
	\right.
\end{equation}
defined on $\Omega$. Here, $p: \Omega \to \mathbb R^+$ is the pressure, $\tau: \Omega \to \mathbb R^{d\times d}$ is the viscous stress tensor, and $S_u = \frac 1 2 ([ \nabla \cdot u] + u\cdot \nabla)$. It is straight forward to check
\begin{equation} \label{eq:3.9}
	\frac{d}{dt} K + \nabla \cdot (Ku) + \nabla \cdot (pu)= \nabla \cdot (\tau u) - (\tau \nabla)\cdot u,
\end{equation}
where $K = \frac 1 2 \sum_{i=1}^d u_i^2 $ is the kinetic energy. Here we used 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:3.10}
	\begin{aligned}
	u\cdot \nabla p &= \nabla \cdot (up) - p\nabla \cdot u, \\
	u \cdot (\nabla \cdot \tau) &= \nabla \cdot (\tau u) - (\tau \nabla)\cdot u,
	\end{aligned} 
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation} \label{eq:3.11}
	u\cdot S_{u}(u) = \nabla \cdot(Ku).
\end{equation}
The only non-conservative term in \eqref{eq:3.9} is $-(\tau \nabla)\cdot u$, which corresponds to dissipation of kinetic energy. Therefore, in the absence of the viscous terms, $K$ is a conserved quantity of the system, and $\frac d {dt} \int_{\Omega} K \ dx <0$ when $\tau\neq 0$. Note that as long as $\nabla \cdot u = 0$, as discussed in \Cref{sec:skew.1}, the divergence, the convective, and the skew-symmetric forms are identical for the incompressible fluid equation. Thus, kinetic energy is conserved for all forms. However, for a general discretization scheme, these forms are not identical, and often the conservation of kinetic energy, in the discrete sense, is violated.

The skew-symmetric discretization of \eqref{eq:3.8} is a centered scheme that exploits the skew-adjoint property of $S_u$, and ensures conservation of kinetic energy at the discrete level. We uniformly discretize $\Omega$ into $N$ points and denote by $\mathbf u \in \mathbb R^{N\times d}$, $\mathbf p \in \mathbb R^N$, and $T \in R^{N\times d\times d} $ the discrete representation of $u$, $p$, and $\tau$, respectively. Let $D_j$ be the centered finite difference matrix operator for $\partial / \partial x_j$, for $j = 1,\dots,d$. The momentum equation in \eqref{eq:3.8} is then discretized as
\begin{equation} \label{eq:3.13}
	\frac{d}{dt}{\mathbf u}_i + S_{\mathbf u} \mathbf u_i + D_i \mathbf p = \sum_{j=1}^d D_j T_{ij}, \quad i=1,\dots,d.
\end{equation}
where $S_{\mathbf u}$ is the discretization of $S_{u}$ given by
\begin{equation} \label{eq:3.14}
	S_{\mathbf u} = \sum_{j=1}^d D_j U_j + U_j D_j,
\end{equation}
and $U_i$ contains components of $\mathbf u_i$ on its diagonal. We require $D_i$ to satisfy
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $D_i = -D_i^T$
	\item $D_i \mathbf 1 = \mathbf 0$, where $\mathbf 1$ and $\mathbf 0$ are vectors of ones and zeros, respectively.
\end{enumerate}
Condition 1 and 2 yield
\begin{equation} \label{eq:3.15}
	S_{\mathbf u} = -S_{\mathbf u}^T, \quad \mathbf 1^T S_{\mathbf u} \mathbf u_i = 0, \quad i=1,\dots,d.
\end{equation}
Conservation of momentum in the discrete sense reads
\begin{equation} \label{eq:3.16}
	\frac{d}{dt} \sum_{i=1}^d  \mathbf 1^T \mathbf u_i = \sum_{i=1}^d \left( - \mathbf 1^T S_{\mathbf u} \mathbf u_i - \mathbf 1^T D_i \mathbf p + \sum_{j=1}^d \mathbf 1^T D_j T_{ij}  \right) = 0.
\end{equation}
Similarly, using \eqref{eq:3.10}, it is verified that
\begin{equation} \label{eq:3.17}
\frac{d}{dt} \sum_{i=1}^d \left( \frac 1 2 \mathbf u_i^T \mathbf u_i \right) = - \sum_{i,j=1}^d T_{ij}D_j \mathbf u_i \leq 0.
\end{equation}

Conditions 1 and 2 for $D_i$ can be easily checked for a centered finite differences scheme on a periodic domain. For other types of boundaries, e.g., wall boundary and inflow/outflow, we refer the reader to \cite{morinishi1998fully,desjardins2008high} for construction of the proper discrete centered differentiation operator. 

\subsection{Compressible Fluid} \label{sec:skew.3}
Consider the equation governing the evolution of a compressible fluid in a skew-symmetric form in one spacial dimension
\begin{equation} \label{eq:3.18}
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
	&\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \rho + \frac{\partial }{\partial x}(\rho u) = 0, \\ 
	& S_{\rho,\partial_t}(u)+ S_{\rho u}(u) + \frac{\partial }{\partial x} p = \frac{\partial }{\partial x} \tau, \\
	&\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \rho E + \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(u E + up) = \frac{\partial }{\partial x}(u\tau - \phi).
\end{aligned}
\right.
\end{equation}
Here $E= e + u^2/2$ is the total energy per unit mass, with $e = \frac{p}{\rho(\gamma - 1)}$ the internal energy, $\gamma$ the adiabatic gas index, and $\phi = -\lambda \frac{\partial T}{\partial x}$ is the heat flux, with $\lambda$ the heat conductivity. The rest of the variables are the same as those discussed in \Cref{sec:skew.2}. Following \cite{reiss2014conservative}, the evolution of the momentum equation reads
\begin{equation} \label{eq:3.19}
	\begin{aligned}
	\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\frac{\rho u^2}{2}) + \frac{\partial }{\partial x}(\rho u \frac{u^2}{2}) &= \frac 1 2 u( \frac{d}{dt} \rho u + \rho \frac{d}{dt} u ) + \frac 1 2 u ( [ \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \rho u ] u + \rho u \frac{\partial }{\partial x} u ) \\
	& = - u \frac{\partial}{\partial x} p + u \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \tau.
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Substituting this into the energy equation in \eqref{eq:3.18} while assuming a constant adiabatic index yields
\begin{equation} \label{eq:3.20}
	\frac{1}{\gamma -1} \frac{d}{dt} p + \frac{\gamma}{\gamma -1} \frac{\partial }{\partial x} up - u \frac{\partial }{\partial x}(p) = - u \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \tau + \frac{\partial }{\partial x}(u\tau - \phi).
\end{equation}

We discretize the real line, uniformly, into $N$ grid points and denote by $\mathbf r, \mathbf u, \mathbf p \in \mathbb R^{N}$, the discrete representations of $\rho$, $u$, and $p$, respectively. Using the matrix differentiation operator $D\in \mathbb R^{N\times N}$ (we omit the subscript ``$i$'' for the one dimensional case), introduced in \Cref{sec:skew.2}, we define the skew-symmetric matrix operator $S_{\mathbf r \mathbf u} = \frac 1 2 (DUR + RUD)$, where $R$ is the matrix that contains $r$ in its diagonal.Now, the semi-discretization of \eqref{eq:3.18} and \eqref{eq:3.20} takes now takes the form
\begin{equation} \label{eq:3.21}
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
	& \frac{d}{dt} \mathbf r + DU\mathbf r = 0, \\
	& S_{\mathbf r,\partial_t} (\mathbf u) + S_{\mathbf r \mathbf u} \mathbf u + D \mathbf p = D T, \\
	&\frac{1}{\gamma -1} \frac{d}{dt} \mathbf p + \frac{\gamma}{\gamma -1} D U \mathbf p - UD\mathbf p = - UDT + D(UT - \mathbf \phi).
\end{aligned}
\right.
\end{equation}

Considering conditions 1 and 2 for $D$, discussed in \Cref{sec:skew.2}, it is easily verified that
\begin{equation} \label{eq:3.22}
	S_{\mathbf r \mathbf u}^T = - S_{\mathbf r \mathbf u}, \quad \mathbf 1^T S_{\mathbf r \mathbf u} \mathbf u = - \mathbf u^T DU \mathbf r.
\end{equation}
Conservation of mass yields
\begin{equation} \label{eq:3.23}
	\frac{d}{dt} (\mathbf 1^T \mathbf r) = - \mathbf 1^T DR\mathbf u = 0. 
\end{equation}
Furthermore, we recover conservation of momentum in the discrete sense as
\begin{equation} \label{eq:3.24}
\begin{aligned}
	\frac{d}{dt}(\mathbf r^T \mathbf u) &= \frac{1}{2} \frac{d}{dt}(\mathbf r^T \mathbf u) + \frac{1}{2} \left( \mathbf r^T \frac d{dt} \mathbf u +\mathbf u^T \frac{d}{dt} \mathbf r \right)\\
	&= \frac{1}{2}u^T \frac d{dt} \mathbf r + \mathbf 1^T S_{\mathbf r,\partial_t} (\mathbf u) \\
	&= -\frac 1 2 \mathbf u^T DU \mathbf r  - \frac 1 2 \mathbf 1^T S_{\mathbf r \mathbf u} \mathbf u - \mathbf 1^T D\mathbf p +  \mathbf 1^T D T = 0.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Here we used \eqref{eq:3.22} and the mass and the momentum equation in \eqref{eq:3.21}. Similarly, for the conservation of the total energy, we have
\begin{equation} \label{eq:3.25}
\begin{aligned}
	\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{1}{\gamma - 1} \mathbf 1^T \mathbf p + \frac 1 2 \mathbf (R\mathbf u)^T \mathbf u  \right) &= \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{1}{\gamma - 1} \mathbf 1^T \mathbf p \right) + \frac 1 2 \mathbf u^T  S_{\mathbf r,\partial_t} (\mathbf u) = 0.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
In addition to the conservation of the total energy, skew-symmetric form of \eqref{eq:3.21} also conserves the evolutions of the kinetic energy:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:3.26}
\begin{aligned}
	\frac{d}{dt} ( \frac 1 2 \mathbf u^T R\mathbf u) = \frac 1 2 \mathbf u^T S_{\mathbf r,\partial_t} (\mathbf u) &= -\mathbf u ^T S_{\mathbf r \mathbf u} \mathbf u + \mathbf u^T D p + \mathbf u^T DT \\
	&= \mathbf u^T D p + \mathbf u^T DT.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Here, we used the skew-symmetry of $S_{\mathbf r \mathbf u}$. Therefore, only the pressure and viscous terms contribute to the change in the level of kinetic energy.

We point out that there are other methods to obtain a skew-symmetric form for \eqref{sec:skew.3}, that result in the conservation of other quantities. An entropy preserving skew-symmetric form can be found in \cite{sjogreen2010skew}. Furthermore, a fully quasi-skew-symmetric form for \eqref{sec:skew.3}, where all quadratic fluxes are in a skew-symmetric form, is shown to have lowest aliasing error \cite{honein2004higher,honein2005numerical}

\subsection{Time integration}
Following steps in \cite{reiss2014conservative,morinishi2010skew} we can construct a fully discrete scheme for \eqref{sec:skew.3} as
\begin{equation} \label{eq:3.27}
	\left\{
	\begin{aligned}
	&\frac 1 2 \sqrt{\mathbf r} ^{n+1/2} \frac{\sqrt{\mathbf r}^{n+1} - \sqrt{\mathbf r}^{n}}{\Delta t} + DU^{n+1/2} \mathbf r^{n} = 0, \\
	& \sqrt{\mathbf r} ^{n+1/2}  \frac{\sqrt{ \mathbf R}^{n+1} u^{n+1} - \sqrt{\mathbf R}^{n}u^n}{\Delta t} + S_{\mathbf r^{n} \mathbf u^n} \mathbf u^{n+1/2}_\alpha + D \mathbf p^{n} = DT^{n}, \\
	& \frac 1 {\gamma -1} \frac{\mathbf p^{n+1} - \mathbf p^n}{\Delta t} + \frac{\gamma}{\gamma -1} D U^{n} \mathbf p - U^{n} D \mathbf p = - U^{n}D T^{n} + D (U^nT^n - \phi^n).
	\end{aligned}
	\right.
\end{equation}
Here, $\Delta t$ is the time discretization unit, superscript $n$ denotes evaluating the variable at $t = n\Delta t$, superscript $n+1/2$ denotes the arithmetic average of the variable at $t=n\Delta t$, the square root sign denotes element-wise application of square root,  and $t=(n+1)\Delta t$ and 
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf u_{\alpha}^{n+1/2} = \frac{\sqrt{\mathbf R}^{n+1} \mathbf u^{n+1} + \sqrt{\mathbf R}^{n} \mathbf u^{n}}{2\sqrt{\mathbf r}^{n+1/2} }
\end{equation}
It is discussed in \cite{reiss2014conservative} that this time discretization scheme preserves the symmetries expressed in \eqref{eq:3.17}, \eqref{eq:3.24}, \eqref{eq:3.25}, and \eqref{eq:3.26}. In the incompressible case, the method reduces to the implicit mid-point scheme \cite{hairer2006geometric}. For further information see \cite{reiss2014conservative,morinishi2010skew}.
